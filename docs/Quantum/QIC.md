## Complex Linear Algebra
- note: inner product of complex vector space is not "bilinear form"
    - instead, a "sesquilinear form"
- review: get familiar with bra-ket/dirac notation 

### Overview
- (bra-ket notation)
- bases and linear independence
- linear operators and matrices
- the Pauli matrices
- inner products
- eigen decompositions
- adjoint and Hermitian operators
- tensor products
- operator functions
- the commutator and anti-commutator
- the polar and singular value decomposition

### bra-ket (Dirac) notation 
![](https://i.imgur.com/YHiG5N5.png =70%x)
- relation to state space and dual space
- view "bra" as linear map from column vector to scalar
    - $\langle \psi | : \mathbb{R}^{n} \to \mathbb{R}$
- complex (Hermitian) inner product
    - http://www.math.umd.edu/~hking/Hermitian.pdf
    - conjugate symmetric
    - linear to the 2nd
    - conjugate linear to the 1st
    - positive definite

Note:
math => linear to the 1st argument, physics linear to the 2nd

### An interesting view by NTHU Math student
- V* x V* -> c ?
- my ans:
    - V* is not V, inner product properties are proterties for instance to follow

### My Q: Field that can support positive definite is necessary number?
