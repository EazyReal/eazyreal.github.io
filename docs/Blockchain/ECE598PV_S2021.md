# Note for ECE 598PV, Spring 2021
https://courses.grainger.illinois.edu/ece598pv/sp2021/

---

## Notations and Theorems

### Notations
- $T$ hardness of POW ($hash < T$)
- $\lambda$ mining rate
- $\beta$ fraction of adversial 
- $\beta \lambda$ adversial power
- $\alpha = 1 - \beta$ fraction of honest nodes
- $\frac{\alpha}{1+\alpha\lambda} \lambda$ honest power when forking for delay

### Bitcoin Theorems
- **Common Prefix**
    - hold with exponential prop if $\beta\lambda < \frac{\alpha \lambda}{1+\alpha\lambda\Delta}$
- **Chain Growth**
    - $CG \ge \frac{\alpha \lambda}{1+\alpha\lambda\Delta}$
- **Chain Quality**
    - $CQ \ge \frac{CG-\beta\lambda}{CG}$

### Remarks
- Block is for batch processing txs.
- Chain is for determining the unique total ordering.
- Blocktree (forking) is inevitable in the presence of asynchrony.
- Consensus is to
    - (non-triviality) decide when fork
    - (security) ensure the choice will not change in the future
    - (liveness) ensure new tx comes in 
- Sharding is to 
    - avoid full replication of storage and computation 
    - allow XCMP
- To achieve sharding in a uniconsensus scheme
    - data availability
    - data integrity
    - shard liveness
- For nakamoto-like
    - Chain Growth + Chain Quility = Liveness
    - Common Prefix = Security

# Module 1. --- Bitcoin

----

## 4.P2P network
- Model as P2P model
- expander graph =>gossip is O(logn)
- can define GST here instead of 6.

----

## 5. Bitcoin system
- UTXO model (set of unspent output)
- TXs (special coinbase txs that mint coins)
- Mempool

----

## 6. Bitcoin safety
- Mining as a Poisson($\lambda$)
- **Common Prefix Property**
- Private Attack is the Worst for Longest Chain Protocol
    - [Nakamoto Block Always Win](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.10484.pdf)
- Analysis
    - 0 Delay (Ideal)
    - Bounded Delay
        - Forking => Honest Power Down 
        - Attack success if $\beta\lambda > \frac{\alpha \lambda}{1+\alpha\lambda\Delta}$

----

    - proposer blocks and proposed txs not included in 
    - CG is geranteed by hardness of $T_{prop}$
    - CQ is optimized by allowing past txs to be included

---

# Module 2. --- Scaling Bitcoin

----

## 8. Scaling throughput
- **Bitcoin’s throughput is security limited**
    - throughput $= \alpha\lambda B$
    - increase $B$ => increase $\Delta$
        - $\Delta \approx \frac{B}{C}+D$
    - increase $\lambda, \Delta$ => security down by theorem
- **GHOST** fork choice rule
    - counter private attack
        - private cannot be heaviest
    - but suffers from balance attack
        - analyze the second moment to get $E(|N_l − N_r|)$ by CS ineq
        - Sudo Yaun says there are "uncles" to prevent balance attack
- **Bitcoin-NG**
    - proposer create tx blocks after elected
    - security problem: adaptive corruption => DOS attack
- **Prism 1.0**
    - ~= Fruitchain
        - no sortition
        - tx blocks POW hardness is low to get high throughput
        - proposer blocks POW is high to get high security

----

## 9. Scaling Latency
- **Bitcoin’s latency is security limited**
    - for $\epsilon$ security (resp. to private attack), need $k$ deep confirmation where
        - $\epsilon = e^{-ck},~c=-\ln(4\alpha\beta)$
        - the latency is thus given by $\tau=\frac{k}{\alpha\lambda}=O(\frac{1}{\lambda}\log \frac{1}{\epsilon})$
    - upperbound on error probability, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14051.pdf
- **Prism**
    - voter trees (similar to boosting in ML, use LoLN)
    - $O(\frac{1}{\lambda})$ with the confirmation rule

----

## 10. Scales Horizontally (Sharding)
- **Key Observation**: 
    - **Data Availability + Total Ordering** is enough
    - Validity can be left to honest nodes and state commitment (if sharded)
- Multiconsensus
    - Protocol
        - Node to Shard Allocation(N2S) engine(SOTA: Randhound (TODO) )
        - Consensus per Shard
    - Examples
        - Elastico, rapidchain and Omniledger
        - Ethereum 2.0 and Polkadot
    - Cons
        - Shard number cannot be large to guarantee adversial count
        - Subjective to Adaptive Adversary
- **Uniconsensus**
    - Protocol
        - Consensus is mentained by all nodes, data are stored by shards
        - DSA (Dynamic Self Allocation) algorithm
    - Examples
        - Free2Shard(Prism + Tx Blocks Sharded) (TODO)
        - Aspen, Nightshade (TODO)
        - Lazyledger (Client Validation + Data Availability Consensus) (TODO)
        - Zilliqa partition validation
        - Polyshard use coded storage + computation (TODO)
- Bootstraping uniconsensus chain
    - problem, cannot trust shard majority
    - state commitment + proof of fraud
        - State roots to reduce size
            - Merle Patricia Tries (see Ethereum Yellow paper)
        - Truebit, Arbitrum style binary searching to give fraud proof
- X-shard TX
    - atomic swap (timeout/abort)
    - example: Atomix, Omniledger

----

## 11. Scales externally
- Payment Channel
    - New primitives
        - mltisig
        - hash lock
        - time lock
    - Do off chain atomic swap (update secret to share new tx)
- **Side Blockchain**
    - Face similar (if not identical) problem to uniconsensus sharding 
    - Data availability problem
        - the problem is **fatal compared to light clients**
            - proposer need to decide whether to include the pointer
        - Fraud and data availability proofs: Maximising light client security and scaling blockchains with dishonest majorities (TODO)
    - Data availability oracle
        - SOTA: Authenticated Coded Dispersal (ACeD) (TODO)
        - make use of CIT(Coded Interleaving Tree) similar to CMT but push instead of pull

----

## 12. Scaling Energe with PoS
- Naive Attempts
    - $H(hash_{prev}, merkle\_root, pk_n) < T · stake$
        - root as nonce
    - $H(hash_{prev},  pk_n) < T · stake$
        - no liveness 
    - $H(hash_{prev}, ts, pk_n) < T · stake$
        - predictibility
    - $VRF(hash_{prev},ts,sk_n) < T · stake$
- Resigning the Previous Blocks (???)
    - (But Blocks are hash linked)
    - Solution: KES
    - (But can still save past pk and give to adaptive adversary)
- **Nothing at Stake**
    - https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/656
    - threshold = $\frac{1}{1+e} \approx 26.89%$
    - Boosting the threshold
        - Ouroboros PoS
            - $VRF(hash_{genesis},ts,sk_n) < T · stake$
            - Vulurable to bribing
        - c-Correlation PoS
            - change hash every c blocks
            - $VRF(RandSource(parent),ts,sk_n) < T · stake$
            - smooth transition
- **Dynamic Stake**
    - Transfer fund between accounts in owned blocks (pk as nonce)
    - solution => [s-truncated longest chain](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/378.pdf)
        - calculate the s blocks after the fork, quicker => win
            - To start dynamic stake attack, it has to control all blocks mined with only small advantage
- My Remarks
    - How is using ts safe? (time interval large enough to match $\Delta$?)
    - Does s-truncated longest chain satisfy the safety and liveness guarantee?
- **Dynamic Availability Using VDF**
    - problem: time machine! mining past blocks is almost costless
    - SOTA: [PoSAT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.08154.pdf)
        - VDF assuming a bounded CPU speed
        - VRF given time bound L i.e. $f^{t=L}(x)$ is a R.V.!
        - $VDF(RandSource(parent),ts,sk_n) < T · stake$
- **Long range attack** (Solved?)
    - bride past stake
    - fixed by ?
        - checkpoint
- My Remarks
    - The defense of long range attack seems open

## 13. Transaction order fairness
- Possible Defs for Fair Orderings of Transactions
- Attempt
    - k deep block can have k view of tx ordering
    - aggregate them get a ordering
- Possible Application: Zero-Block Confirmation (In ref.)
- Reference
    - Order-Fair Consensus in the Permissionless Setting
- My Remarks
    - seems an open direction (less technical arguments)
    - consider "all miners" are malicious in tx ordering would be a more practical assumption
        - use game theory to solve!

# Module 3: Beyond Bitcoin

----

## 14. Blockchain protocols with finality: Streamlet and HotStuf
Nakamoto-like favors liveness, while PBFT-like favors safety.  
Note: for this lecture, the slide is much more readible.
- Nakamoto-like
    - Probabilistic Safety Guarantee, Synchronous Network Assumption
    - Can we offer finality, and even if the network is not synchronous?
- General Setting for PBFT protocols
    - permissioned, $n$ fixed
    - proposer can be chosen randomly (RandHood) or round robin
    - need $f < \frac{1}{3}$ (consider signature hiding)
    - When 2f+1 votes exist on a block they can form a Quorum Certificate (QC).

### [Streamlet](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/088.pdf)
A naive textbook protocol
- https://dahliamalkhi.github.io/posts/2020/12/what-they-didnt-teach-you-in-streamlet/
- Assumptions
    - partial sync (exists GST)
    - echo
        - rounds operate in lock-step with $2\Delta$ duration
        - each node broadcast the message it receives to others
- Protocol (in round, exists given partial sync)
    - proposal extends the longest notarized chain
    - all nodes vote (sign) for the first proposal they see from the round’s proposer if it extends their longest notarized chain(s).
    - When a block gains votes from more than $\frac{2n}{3}$ distinct nodes, it becomes notarized. 
- Core Properties
    - Safety
        - The Hide and Reveal Attack
            - reveal blocks only to $\frac{2}{3}-f < x < \frac{2}{3}$ nodes
        - 3-chain rule is safe
            - Given 3 consecutive blocks, the middle one can be confirmed
            - Proof correctness by contraction of two possible cases
    - Liveness 
        - Once there are 5 consecutive rounds of honest proposers, a new honest block will be confirmed (the first two can be not notarized)
        - Echo is required or attacker can hide infinitely long and trick a node into dead lock
        - Notice that it progresses only during "periods of synchrony"
            - => await the slowest, not responsive
- Efficiency
    - Message complexity: $N^2(B+NV)$
    - Delay: $\approx 15 \Delta$ 
        - from 5 consecutive rounds ($2\Delta$) of honest majority 
        - better than BTC

### [Hotstuff](https://dahliamalkhi.github.io/posts/2019/08/hotstuff-three-chain-rules/)
- Contribution: First PBFT protocol that achieves
    - Linearity (of message complexity)
    - Responsiveness (advance at the speed of network delay)
    - Chain Quality
- Assumption
- Protocol
    - HighQC: QC with highest epoch number (for node i)
    - A block is linked to its parent via the parent's QC
    - Algo
        - A leader extends its HighQC
            - on receiving a new QC
        - A node votes for the proposal if it extends its highQC
            - the vote is only sent to the next leader
        - Final if 3-chain rule satisfied
- Core Properties
    - Safety (same as Streamlet)
    - Liveness (responsive for event (new QC) driven))
- Efficiency
    - Communication Complexity
        - Nodes only send message to next proposer $O(N(B+V))$ (with cosig)
    - Delay: Responsive 
- Details and Notes
    - This is the protocol behind Diem (facebook => meta => silvergate)
        - https://developers.diem.com/docs/technical-papers/state-machine-replication-paper/
    - comparison to tendermint and [casper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.09437.pdf) (2-chain rule + partial sync => waiting)
        - https://dahliamalkhi.github.io/posts/2019/08/hotstuff-three-chain-rules/
    - PaceMaker for proposer election
    - Chained Hotstuff for parallelization
- My Remarks
    - The leader is predictible thus adaptive corruptable!!
    - All leader-based protocols violate liveness unless a leader cannot proof it is leader and get corrupted
        - e.g. POW (sealed block), Snow Consensus

### Remarks
- Protocol Forensics
    - Can detect $\frac{n}{3}$ double signing behavior if a fork ever happens
- Conclusions
    - A permissionless architecture and is robust to adaptive adversaries
    - Liveness is weakened to favor security (finality)
    - Honest participation is needed now, unlike the longest chain protocol that allowed dynamic participation and even a single honest miner ensured liveness.
    - How to have both finality and dynamic availability (liveness even under varying participation levels of honest nodes) is the topic of L16.
