    2. $\exists \ k\ \ni T^k \in span\{w, T(w), T^2(w), T^3(w)...T^{k-1}(w)\}$ for V is finite-dimentional
    3. $T^k(w)$ is linear combination of $\alpha$
    4. by induction , $T^{n}$ with $n > k$ is too
    5. then $T(\vec{w}) \in W$ is trivial

* invariant subspace is useful for analyzing  

## week 2-1(March/9th/2020)

* 3/10/2020 ask teacher 
* teacher explained in detailed and intuively
* What's the problem?
* Why invariant subspace?
    * to create more 0 
* Why Annihilator?
    * to get blocks of invariant subspaces
* Usage of Cayley-Hamilton Theorem?
    * find such a f(x) quickly
* The next will be Jordan form
    * what to fill in blocks?
* btw, diagonizable and invertible is independent
    * [link](https://yutsumura.com/true-or-false-every-diagonalizable-matrix-is-invertible/)

### !T-invariant subspaces
* to find a basis $\alpha$ $\ni$ 
* and extend the basis from span W to span V
* then the matrix representation of T : V->V
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
T|_W & A \\
O & B
\end{pmatrix}
$$
* if we get direct sum of T-invariant subspaces
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
T|_{W_1} & O \\
O & T|_{W_2}
\end{pmatrix}
$$

### Annihilator - Ann(T)
* $L(V,V) \rightarrow \ set\ of \ polynomials$
* $for\ T \in L(V,V),\ Ann(T) = \{f(x)\in F[x]\mid f(T)\ is \ 0\ transformation\}$
* a way to get decomposition of $V$ to direct sum of T-invariant subspaces 

### !Cayley-Hamilton Theorem
* $f_T(T) \in Ann(T)$
* in this case, the usage is to find a $f(x) \ni f(T)\equiv 0$
* proof:
$\forall v \in V$, let T invariant subspace generated by $v$ be $W$
$let\ V=W+W^{'}$ 
since $[T]_{W+W^{'}}$ can be express as
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
T|_{W} & A \\
O & B
\end{pmatrix}
$$
$f_{T|_{W+W^{'}}}(T) = g(x)f_{T|_W}(x)$ Note that g(x) is the $det(\lambda I-B)$ part
$f_{T|_W}(v) = 0$ from collagory that followed directly with definition of $T|_W$
$Q.E.D.$

\end{pmatrix}
$$

### Theorem 

## Week 3-2 skipped, 3-3(self study@Saturday)

### !Th. - V can be decomposed with Nilpotent LT(on V)
![](https://i.imgur.com/xHP8xXc.png)

#### Proof sketch of part 3(2020/3/23, correct by teacher)
:::info
let T be nilpotent LT on V of index k+1
choose $v_i$ s.t. $T^{k}(v_i)$ forms a basis of $Im(T^{k})$ 

Objective : 
$V = W\bigoplus cyclic(v_i)$ for some T-invariant subspace $W$

Proof:
- key : must have **dot diagram** in mind
- Induction on k+1, index of T
- $W$ as the left part removing higher dimension cyclic subspaces
- extension of basis is like finding the current longest given the past longest
    - $v_i$ past longest
    - $u_i$ current longest

1. when $k = 0, T = 0, T^0 = I$, holds trivially
2. when k holds
    -  $V = ker(T^k) \bigoplus Fv_i$
        - devide V to apply $T^k$ is 0 or non-zero
    -  $V^{'} = ker(T^k)$, $T^{'} = T|_{V^{'}}$
        -  $T^{'}$ is nilpotent on $V^{'}$ of index k
    -  Now we find a basis of $Im({T^{'}}^{k-1})$, a subspace of $ker(T^k)$
        -  part original: 
            -  from $v_i$ to $T(v_i)$
            -  ${T^{'}}^{k-1} (T(v_i))$ = $T^k(v_i)$
            -  l.i. subset of $Im({T^{'}}^{k-1}))$
        -  part extended:
            -  $u_i$
    -  $ker(V) = W_0 \bigoplus cyclic(T(v_i)) \bigoplus cyclic(u_i)$
        -  by induction hypotesis
        -  $T(v_i) \bigoplus u_i$ forms basis of $Im({T^{'}}^{k-1})$
    -  $V = ker(T^k) \bigoplus Fv_i$
    -  $V = W_0 \bigoplus cyclic(u_i) \bigoplus cyclic(T(v_i)) \bigoplus Fv_i$
    -  $V = W \bigoplus cyclic(v_i)$
        -  since $cyclic(u_i)$ is T-invariant
3. by induction, Q.E.D.
- by the proof step can actually see W is cyclic subspaces' direct sum

## HW3

## Week 4-1(2020/3/23)

### !Jordan Form

#### part 1
- for a LT T
- $V = \bigoplus ker_\infty(T-\lambda_i I)$
- $V = \bigoplus E_\infty(\lambda_i)$
#### part 2
- $T-\lambda I$ is nilpotent on $E_\infty(\lambda_i)$
- $E_\infty(\lambda_i) = \bigoplus cyclic(v_i)$
#### part 3
- these $cyclic(v_i)$s have a representation of  
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 0 & 0 & ...&0 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & ...&0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & ...&0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & ...&0 \\
...&...&...&...&0
\end{pmatrix}
$$
#### Conclusion
- Jordan Form 

#### Uniqueness?
- General Eigenspace Decomposition (YES)
- Cyclic Subsapce Decomposition (No)
    - but the dimensions are unique
- generally, the matrix rep. can be said to be unique

#### Steps to find a Jordan form matrix rep.
1. find $f_A(x)$
2. find **dot diagram** for each $\lambda$
    - by observe the nulity of $(T-\lambda I)^k$
ex:
0 <- $T(v_2)$ <- $v_2$
0 <- $v_1$

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
\lambda & 1 & 0 \\
0 & \lambda & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \lambda \\
\end{pmatrix}
$$

#### Steps to find a Jordan basis
1. just solve it from basis of $E\infty(\lambda)$


#### Case Study
1. 
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
5 & 7 & 1 & 1 & 5 \\
-2 & -3 & -1 & -1 & -5 \\
-1 & -3 & 1 & 1 & -3 \\
0 & 0 & 3 & 0 & 1 \\
3 & 3 & 1 & 0 & 6
\end{pmatrix}
$$
2.
let V be a subspace of real funcitons spanned by $\alpha = \{x^{-2}e^x, xe^x, e^x\}$
let D be the differential operator
find Jordan form of D and its jordan basis

### Jordan Chevalley Decomposition

$A = P^{-1}(D+N)P = P^{-1}DP + P^{-1}NP$ 
where
$P^{-1}DP$ is semi-simple part
$P^{-1}DP$ is nilpotent part

- $\forall A \in M_n(\mathbb{C})$ there exist unique $D,N \in M_n(\mathbb{C})$ 
    - A = D + N
    - DN = ND
    - D is diagonizanle
    - N is nilpotent

### Advantage of Jordan Form

#### power of matrix
- by $(D+N)^k$ with the fact that N is nilpotent

## Week 7 - Real Canonical Form

### analysis of real matrix A
- pairs of conjecate roots of $f_A(X)$
    - pairs of eigenvalues
- conclusion
    - for a eigenvalue $\lambda=a-bi$, and $\vec{v}$ be the corresponding eigenvector
    - let $v = v_1+iv_2$
    - $A(v_1+iv_2) = (av_1+bv_2) + i(-bv_1 + av_2)$
    - notice that v1, v2 must be l.i.
        - else the eigen value is real number
- complex block is 
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
a & -b\\ 
b & a\\
\end{pmatrix}
$$
    
### analysis of othogonal matrix A
- $\lambda_i = e^{-i\theta_i}=cos\theta_i-isin\theta_i$
- complex block is 
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
cos\theta & -sin\theta\\ 
sin\theta & cos\theta\\
\end{pmatrix}
$$
- thus we can see **orthogonal matrix** as **reflextions + 2D-rotations**
- notice that $\beta$(change of basis) can be chosen to be orthonormal

## Week 7 - Equivalent Quadratic Forms, Signature

### Equivalent Quadratic Form
- def, two quadratic form is called Euivalent iff
    - can obtain each other by change of basis
    - but since we want signature => need not to be orthonormal
- Diagonal Form
- note the simbol usage
    - $Q(\vec{x}^t)$
    - more common to use row vector to repr. variable

### Review, change of variable to diagonal form
![](https://i.imgur.com/1MMbSdv.jpg)
- note that $\vec{y}^tD\vec{y} = \sum_i\lambda_iy_i^2$

#### use orthogonal instead of orthonormal basis 
![](https://i.imgur.com/O13xj9G.png)

#### Standard form : above is to change diagonal matrix to +-1
![](https://i.imgur.com/JgFP6UQ.png)

### Signature of Real Quadratic Forms
![](https://i.imgur.com/P2gXonW.png)
- Note: trace of standard form(i.e., signature) + rank can decide standard form

### Signature <=>(1-to-1) Eq Quadratic Forms

### Taylor Expansion for determining local min/max
- terms of poly of $dx_i$
- higher order terms are dominated by lower order ones
    - multiply of infinity smalls
- we use diagonalize technique to make thing easy
    - chage of variable so that 
    - only square terms is non-zero

### about Trace
- $tr(AB) = tr(BA)$ poof by direct calculation
- for more, ex: ABC
    - treat AB as D or BC as D and reduce to 2 matrix case
    - $tr(ABC) \neq tr(BAC)$ in general
- $tr(A) = PDP^{-1}) = tr(DP^{-1}P) = tr(D)$ in this case

## Weel 8 - Positive Definite Quadratic Form

### Equivalences and proof
- Q is positive definite()
- A is positive definite(eigenvalue)
- Q has has unique minimun at 0

#### Case of semi

### Theorem of n1 is 

### Sylvester's critirien 

#### Induction Proof

### extreme values at 0?

### Example
- Q, not positive definite, by can be semi-positive definite?
    - should check higher order?(the conclusion of not local extreme is too fast IMO)
    - A(myself): bad Q, this is not discussion for derivatives(Hessian)

### What does Quntum Computing study
- Q: is lie Group/Algebra related?
    - Yes, bried introduction
- A: to make "good" universal gates
    - traditional bit and gate($(1,0)^N \to (1,0)^M$)

    - Me: and apply them efficiently is the algo part
- Q: What should I study
    - a variety of fields 
    - dont need to be deep, but know the essential concepts
    - cause there are many isomorphic realations between fields
    - think of the problem on ball and design way to higher dimension

### self study + Q for night office hour
- hermitian > normal 
    * + eigenvalues all real?
- [link: EQ def normal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_matrix#Equivalent_definitions)
    - normal := A* and A commute 
    - normal <=> A* is poly of A
    - normal <=> A and A∗ can be simultaneously diagonalized
        - Actually, $A^* = P^tD^{bar}P$ by proof in pdf?
- commute <=> Simultaneous Diagonalizability
    - [Thm. 5.1](https://kconrad.math.uconn.edu/blurbs/linmultialg/minpolyandappns.pdf)
    - also Thm. 4.11 for equivalence of diagonalizability

### online TA hour
- diagonal represent as poly <=> poly n->n need n-1 degree
    - Lagrange construction
- if A want to be represent as poly(B)
    - if B position i, j is same, A pos i, j has to be same
    - degree smaller
- commute and both diagonalizable <=> Simultaneous Diagonalizability
- + AB reltation stated can <=> A can be poly of B
- T and T* commute iif T* is poly of T is true
    - consider after diagonalized(always can do, normal)
    - T* is just $T^{bar}$
    - then use Lagrange construction
- proof trick
- 5-a
![](https://i.imgur.com/MvWVGWc.png)
- about projection
    - pairwise product is zero transformation
        - lecture note is wrong
    - sum is idendity
- matrix congruence, quadratic form change of variable
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_congruence
    - is undser "orthogonal basis"

### Remainning Q
- taylor expansion for extreme value in genreal
    - my guess, 0, +-, 0, +- ...

## Week 13 - SVD 

### Best fit subspace

#### motivation and eq defs

### left singular values

### best fit subspace and SVD
- proof by induction on k

### Note on details
- $rank(A^tA) = rank(AA^t) = rank(A)$
    - proof by definition  + norm def
    - https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/349738/prove-operatornamerankata-operatornameranka-for-any-a-in-m-m-times-n
- $A^tA$ is symmetic
- $A^tA$ is semi-positive definite
- $A^tA$ has **orthonormal eigen decomposition**
 
### relation with right singular value
- $Av_i = \sqrt{\lambda_i}u_i$
- can proof this will be left eighebasis for A^t


### SVD - the decoomposition
- standard basis => alpha{v} => sinvular value diagonal matrix(m*n) => beta => standard basis
- $U\sum V^t$
- $Av_i = \sqrt{\lambda_i}u_i$
- $A = \sum _{i=1}^r \sqrt{\lambda_i}u_iv_i^t$
    - obs: sum of rank one matrices 


### compact SVD
- use only $m*r, r*r, r*n$

### confusion
- not famil

### SVD view of best fit k-subspace

### Compression with SVD

### PCA - best fit affine subspace
- max variance subspace

### SVD vs PCA
- care mean or not

## Week 14 - Discrete-Time Markov Chain
- the lecture
    - capture the eigen-related features of transition matrix
    - discuss the asymptotic trend when apply the same P infty time

### Positive Matrix
- defined by entry

### P(Probability) vector and Transition Matrix
- P-vector
    - entry sum to 1
- T-matrix
    - each column is a P-vector


### Eigenvalues of Positive Transition Matrix abs "<= 1"
- proof
![](https://i.imgur.com/XNaGNfd.png)

### The eigenvalue "1"
- 1 is the only (in complex number set) eigenvalue with abs 1
    - triangular inequality

#### Geometric Multiplicity = 1
- reminder: geo multiplicity = how many Jordan block = rank of eigenspace
- proof
    - to make = 1
    - required $|v_i| = |v_j|~\forall i,j$
        - refer to last section(proof all eigen abs <= 1)
        - for replace j with i
    - since P is positive
        - for take in the abs 
        - all v_i have same sign
        - HW explicitly proof this
- conclusion
    - $v = v_i(1,1,1,...,1) = v_i\vec{1}$ is the only eigenvector of abs 1 eigenvalue

#### All Jordabn block of eigenvalue one is of size 1
- reminder: dot diagram
- proof by contradiction

## Week 14 : Q on transition matrix
- what happen if the P is "stuck"?
    - A, B, C state
    - A to A, B to C, C to B
    - start A => A
    - start B/C => 0.5B + 0.5C
![](https://i.imgur.com/aXFdy0i.png)
- ans : "positive" = > rank = 1

- will eigenvalue of P be all positive? or 0
    - 0 means non-trivial nullspace exist 

### HW 11 - if $P^k$ is positive, how about P
- can use positive transition result
- hint: P eigenvalue $\lambda$ => P^k eigenvalue $\lambda^k$

## Week 15 - Commuting LT

### Eigenspace of T1 is T2-invariant subspace
- proof by $\forall v \in E_{T_1}(\lambda), T_1T_2v = T_2T_1v=T_2\lambda v$
- $E_{T_1}(\lambda)$ is T2 invariant

### Simutaneously Diagonalizable
- restriction of a diagonalizable LT on an invariant subspace is still diagonalizable

### What about Jordan
- nilpotent counter example

### Spectral drawing and symmetric
- $\sigma : V \to V$ be LT that change the vertices is still same graph
    - than $L$(the Laplance) and $\sigma$ is commutable
- pick the eigenspaces as a whole => symmetric!
    - since the picked eigenspaces are $\sigma -invariant$
