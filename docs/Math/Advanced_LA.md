## Lecture 2 (9/23/2020)

### Capter 2
- Equivalent Classes
    - well-definedness
        - independence of choice of representative
- Quotients
    - exercises
- Direct Sum
    - internal v.s. external
    - ignore the difference since they are quite equal
    - direct sum and Cartesian product are different when there are infinitely many of vector spaces
        - direct sum => finitely many non zero 
- Exact sequences
    - more related to Differential Geometry and Differential Topology
    - the teacher listed it for a simple preview, will not dive into it

### Chapter 3, Modules and Algebras
- Modules
    - Modules are generalizations of vector spaces.
    - Recall that a vector space is a field $F$ and an abelian group $V$ together with scalar multiplication $F \times V \to V$ which satisfies (1.1). In (1.1), there is no mention of the inverse of any element of $F$, so $F$ can simply be a ring with 1. In that case we call $V$ a module over the ring $F$. 
    - example:
        - $\mathbb{Z}^n$ is a module of ring $\mathbb{Z}$
- Algebra 
    - have an additional operator to vector space
    - $* : V \times V \to V$
        - distributive: $(v+w)∗x=v∗x+w∗x$ and $x∗(v+w)=x∗v+x∗w$
        - take out scalar: $(cx) ∗ v = x ∗ (cv) = c(x ∗ v).$
    - note that $*$ may not be
        - commutative
        - associative
        - do not have multicative identity
    - extra note on definition of ring
    - example:
        - $M_n(F)$ with matrix multiplication
        - $M_n(F)$ with $A*B = AB-BA$

Note:
- quaternions H and octonions O 
- $N \subset Z \subset Q \subset R \subset C \subset H \subset O$
