# Projects

## zkAlpha
zkAlpha connects quant traders and liquidity providers w/o revealing the strategy through the use of
zkSNARKs. I was responsible for the protocol design, smart contract pseudocode, and zero-knowledge circuits. My
teammates contributed to frontend, smart contract development based on pseudocode, and demo. The project won 7
prizes (including Filecoin grand prize and 1inch 2nd place) and 8863 USD in total out of 1400 attendees and 321
projects.

## Bulk Mint NFTs
I identified and exploited a weakness in a smart contract to mint multiple NFTs in [one transaction](https://polygonscan.com/tx/0x539c2077b724e71b370a9ea5bc6aaa626fdfcfa16377437b8a5d513687147916) bypassing a one per account restriction. I reminded the company and asked for permission before using the code moderately.

##  Qiskit ALCom Provider
We integrated a new quantum simulator to the Qiskit Aer library and won the Best Presentation Award of [NTU-IBMQ 2020 QCamp](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-hackathon-taiwan-20/issues/17).

## EazyNoGo
I programmed a NoGo AI based on Monte Carlo Tree Search with Rapid Action Value Estimation in C++. This is the individual study project in the 2019 fall semester at [NCTU CGI lab](https://cgilab.nctu.edu.tw/) advised by Dr.I-Chen Wu.
